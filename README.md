# esri-webappbuilder-widget-eDraw
Ehanced draw widget for WebApp Builder for Arcgis.

Fork of the official widget draw for WebApp Builder for Arcgis :
http://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/create-apps/widget-draw.htm

Some UI changes (@TODO) :
- hiding style chooser after feature draw (the user know he has to re-choose the draw type)
- warning user if he chooses text draw and hav'nt type the text.
- Add draws list :
  - focus on a draw
  - delete a draw
  - move up or dawn a draw
